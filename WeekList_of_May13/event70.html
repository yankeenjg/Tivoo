As she breaks free of her coddled life, proving herself to be a competent and assertive woman of action, she realizes, like many other women who discovered feminism in the 1970s, that the personal really is political. But when her husband returns from a restful cruise in top form, things get complicated. Gérard Depardieu plays a former union leader and Suzanne's ex-beau who still has feelings for her. Features impeccable 70s era set design and costumes! -- Post-screening discussion with Prof. Anne-Gaëlle Saliot!</p></body></html>

This exhibit includes selections from Allison's writings, activism, and personal life. Sponsored by the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture, part of Duke University Libraries, and by the Duke Women's Studies Program. On display in the Rare Book Room Cases, Perkins Library.</p></body></html>
